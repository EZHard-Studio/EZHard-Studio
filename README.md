### skills breakdown

| Skill | score |why I'm scoring myself this way| 
| :-------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Android studio - Java | 8/10 | I have been problem-solving, reading, and distilling different documentation, self-learning, and improving for five years. I have gained confidence with Android lifecycle, MVVM architecture, and Firebase BOM libraries. I would score myself higher if I had similar time and experience with Java I/O and the best way to integrate it into a proper Android app.
|React -TypeScript |5/10|With an above-average understanding of the Redux, React-Router, and MUI libraries, combined with pre-existing familiarity with the Firebase SDK, I have come to appreciate the power of these skills. Although I have only been using these tools for about 2 years and have not yet completed a proper web app, I would consider myself an average user
|Git|3/10|As of today, all of my projects have been solo. Although I have encountered Git throughout my years of app development, I have not yet utilized these tools properly. While I continue to strive to improve my toolbox, I am eager to learn and improve with Git concepts, starting with GitHub. I recognize that I have much to learn and that I have missed out on a great methodology for approaching big projects. I am excited for the experience to come and for my developer skills to improve even further.
